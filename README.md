# Regressor
Comparative evaluation of supervised machine learning algorithms in the prediction of the relative density of 316L stainless steel fabricated by selective laser melting.
7 supervised machine learning regressors are compared: support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DTR), random forest (RFR), gradient boosting (GBR), Gaussian process (GPR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
